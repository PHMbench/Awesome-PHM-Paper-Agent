  abstract={This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework for bearing fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to analyze vibration signals and classify different fault types. Experimental validation on a benchmark dataset demonstrates 97.5% accuracy in fault classification, outperforming traditional machine learning methods.},
