  abstract={This paper presents an Unsupervised Class Incremental Learning Network (UCILN) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in cross-domain fault diagnosis. The method incorporates a memory module with semifrozen and semiupdated incremental strategy that balances retention of old knowledge with acquisition of new information.},
