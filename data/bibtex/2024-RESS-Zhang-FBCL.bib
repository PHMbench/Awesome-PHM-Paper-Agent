  abstract={This paper proposes a Feature Boosting Based Continual Learning Method (FBCL) to address catastrophic forgetting in bearing fault diagnosis with incremental fault types. The method enhances plasticity while maintaining stability through selective feature enhancement and memory-based knowledge retention.},
