  abstract={This paper presents FD-LLM, a framework for fine-tuning large language models (Llama3 and Llama3-instruct) for multi-class fault classification. The framework demonstrates strong fault detection capabilities and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in many cases using novel encoding methods for vibration signals.},
